## Overview
This is an end-to-end Machine Learning Project. The working web [app](https://tinyurl.com/flight-fare-prediction) will predict the fare of your flight. It will ask the departure city, arrival city, departure date & time and total stops to predict the same.    
The primary goal of this project was to learn and implement an end-to-end ML project. After doing a few courses and participating in a few competitions I felt a need to do a project to understand how machine learning is used in application. With this project I got the oppurtunity to learn HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flask, Heroku.   
<ins>**_Disclaimer_**</ins> : _Performance of the machine learning model was not the primary goal and there is a lot of [scope](#scope) of improvement for the project in this area._
